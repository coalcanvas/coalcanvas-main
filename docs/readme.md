# Minimal Dependency Three.js Project

## Notes

The purpose of the app is to as much as possible try to 'gamify' the platform.

Getting better at Threejs thanks to tutorials from Udemy instructors like Christopher Lis. Excited to follow his next lesson on inserting data-points onto the THREE objects, since i come from the data industry.

Experimenting with single-page application. Site is loading right with fast LCP.

Don't understand the value of Sass or LESS, therefore PostCSS.

Found bundling setup to be ultra tedious, may want to try rollup as the setup for webpack is complicated for me, and the changing syntax wasn't helpful.
Couldn't solve the errors even while following documentation.

May want to try Rollup after finding a pretty comprehensive tutorial from Jason Lengstorf@Netlify.
